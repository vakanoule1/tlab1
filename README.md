# CLI Health Monitoring App - Normal Version

You are a software developer at of a Taiwan-based wearable health-tech firm called Seng-Links. For your next project, you will assist in the creation of an application which will ingest 8 hours of user inputted heart-rate data and rate their quality of sleep. As the final project will take many months of hardware and software development, you are tasked with solely designing a simple command-line application which developers can use to prototype to product. 

Your manager has completed the framework of this project, along with pertinent instructions, but now relies on your Python knowledge and documentation-reading skills to complete the rest.

## Instructions

Access the `main.py` folder and fill in all missing code underneath each comment. Each comment will describe what your code should be doing. This file will heavily utilize the `input()` function and a few list methods. Be sure to review your recordings, notes, slides, and previous work to figure out which line of code you should implement.
